    "It is very important that your entire program is contained within a function. It is also very important that your output value is returned and not merely printed. This is to make sure that the function, when called, actually evaluates to a value instead of merely printing the calculated value out to the terminal. This is because the function, conceptually, is intended to be a utility function for further conversions, so it needs to evaluate to a value on its own.\n",
    "The function must accept the input through one parameter called dollars.\n",
    "The function must return a string that is formatted as follows: {dollars} US dollar(s) = {pesos} Philippine pesos., where dollars is the amount of dollars given as input and where pesos is the equivalent amount of pesos for the given dollars.\n",
